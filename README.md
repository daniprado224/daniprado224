### About me: 
- Recent graduate from Lehigh University with a degree in Computer Science & Engineering from the P.C Rossin School of Engineering. 
- An aspiring sofwtare engineer or data analyst looking for opportunities in the world of fashion, music, sports, and movies.
- Currently working as an intern for 20/15 Visioneers, a company focused on working with technology big pharma to understand and process big pharma data. 
- As a personal project, I am working on analyzing data from the industries I am interested in, and get a deeper understanding of how these industries function.
- I am driven engineer who is always on the search for my next passion project.

### Personal Projects:
### Deep Dive Into Lionel Messi:
- Analyzing 700+ of Messi’s goals in his career by using data visualization and regression models in R Programming Language. Created bar graphs, scatterplots, pie charts and logistic and linear regression models on his statistics, taking into consideration season, rival, position played, and competition. The dataset includes information about the games Messi scored while he played in FC Barecelona and Paris St. Germain.
  
### Can AI Understand Music?
- This was an Indepdendent Study project during my Senior Year of university. The project was split in two parts, the first one exploring how humans and AI share similarities and differences in the understanding music by using two definitions of "understanding music". The first definition centers on technical proficiency, while the second focuses on emotional and spiritual connections. Human brain responses during music creation and perception are examined through fMRI studies, revealing cognitive patterns and emotional triggers. AI, exemplified by models like ChatGPT and Musilingo, showcases in music analysis, composition, and emotion detection. However, it struggles to express genuine empathy or emotions. The study concludes that AI, with its remarkable technical capabilities, has the possibility of understanding music emotionally in the near future.
  
- The second part of the research studied AI’s use in music recommender systems by using machine learning techniques and my personal data from Spotify. Through the process of data preprocessing and mining, I cleaned and standardized the data given to me by Spotify. I also searched for music data on Kaggle and cleaned and preprocessed that too for the second part of the research. Once this process was done, I used a K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to amass over 50 accurate music recommendations.

 - Overrall, this project highlighted the ethical and technical complexities AI has on the music industry. To me, it showcased how important it is to study and underatand evolving technologies.
